My heart is free\nYou've forgiven me
Your name's the sweetest sound to my ears,
Lord hold me near\nI'm in love, love with You
Like I never dreamed
I'm in love, love with You
And I'm flying free
From the things that tie me down
I'm walking on the ground
I'm in love, love with You\n
You're all I think about
Day and night all the time
How you make my world\nGo 'round and make it stop
You're all I got"

With much, with less
With joy, with pain
With life, with death\nThe only things that satisfy come from You
They come from You\nEverything that's beautiful
Everything that's wonderful
Every perfect gift comes from You
\nYour grace, Your heart
Your voice, Your touch
Your word, Your peace
Your hope, Your love\nA thousand words could not explain
A thousand worlds could not contain
Every perfect gift comes from You\nIt comes from the Father of Lights
It comes from the Giver of Life
It comes from the Heavens above
It's coming straight from Your heart
To the people You love"

Creation's revealing Your majesty
From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring
Every creature unique in the song that it sings
All exclaiming\nIndescribable, uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
You are amazing God
All powerful, untameable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing God\nWho has told every lightning bolt where it should go
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
None can fathom\nIndescribable, uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name
You are amazing God
All powerful, untameable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing God
You are amazing God\nIndescribable, uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.

You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same
You are amazing God

Echoes in my soul
I hear the music ring\nAnd though the storms may come
I am holding on
To the rock I cling
\nHow can I keep from singing Your praise
How can I ever say enough
How amazing is Your love
How can I keep from shouting Your name
I know I am loved by the King
And it makes my heart want to sing\nI will lift my eyes
In the darkest night
For I know my Savior lives\nAnd I will walk with You
Knowing You'll see me through
And sing the songs You give\nI can sing in the troubled times
Sing when I win
I can sing when I lose my step
And fall down again
I can sing 'cause You pick me up
Sing 'cause You're there
I can sing 'cause You hear me, Lord
When I call to You in prayer
I can sing with my last breath
Sing for I know
That I'll sing with the angels
And the saints around the throne"
